# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Blog. 

I have started with my blog a few weeks ago. At the moment i am making a few changes of the look. 
But i hope it will be finished soon. ðŸ˜„

The blog will be about Cyber-Security, Pentesting and other Tech-specific topics. 

But most it will be about walkthroughs of my Pentestings rooms. 

I will also post about my progress of the PNPT-Certification.
